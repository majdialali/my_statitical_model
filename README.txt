
model's description:




This project is a demonstration on my knowlegde in some fundemental topics of statistics like
median, standard_diviation, quartiles, z_scores, and coefficient_of_variance, in additional to detecting outliers in data. 
Every consept/topic is represented by a function, and those functions work together as a unit inside a class.

This basic model is a step on the way for me to build a somehow completed statistical model 
where it can be a good altarnative to the use of statistical libraries like stats.

Further,  this model will be useful in building a series of some AI-algorithms from scratch by me.

Obs. 
-This model works fine, and tested on real-life data in mu other repos like "web crawler". 
This is why I thought that there is no need to include testing in this repo.
-I followed the best practices of OOP.
