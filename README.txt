
model's description:




This project is a demonstration on my knowlegde in some fundemental topics of statistics like
median, standard_diviation, quartiles, z_scores, and coefficient_of_variance, in additional to detecting outliers in data. 
Every consept/topic is represented by a function, and those functions work together as a unit inside a class.

This basic model is a step on the way for me to build a somehow completed statistical model 
where it can be a good altarnative to the use of statistical libraries like stats.

Regarding testing, the model is implemented on numeric data. 


I followed the best practices of OOP.
Further,  this model will be useful in building a series of some AI-algorithms from scratch by me.
